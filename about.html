    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Mariya Gorbatenko is a multidisciplinary creative whose work blurs the lines between visual arts, fashion, and cinematic narrative. With an innate ability to craft compelling stories through imagery, Mariya doesn't simply create; she builds immersive worlds, frame by carefully directed frame.</p>

    <p>Her distinctive vision is profoundly shaped by the evocative power of cinematic storytelling and the aspirational artistry of Vogue-quality aesthetics. For Mariya, every photograph is a moment paused from a larger, unfolding film – a deliberate visual word in a rich narrative. Whether taking on the role of director, stylist, or photographer, her core purpose remains unwavering: to be a storyteller first and foremost.</p>

    <p>Drawing inspiration from the meticulous detail of a film set, the emotional arc of a character's journey, and the polished sophistication of editorial fashion, Mariya imbues her work with depth and purpose. She believes that every garment, every prop, and every curated environment contributes to the visual plot, elevating a mere image into an experience. This philosophy extends to her own creations, from the sculptural form of a handmade bag to the ambient glow of wooden and woven lamps crafted for set decoration; each piece serves as a key 'character' or crucial 'set dressing' designed to enrich the narrative.</p>

    <p>Mariya's portfolio showcases a remarkable versatility, capturing diverse subjects across varying seasons and cityscapes, always with an eye for compelling composition and refined detail. It is a testament to her unique ability to transform concepts into powerful visual statements – a series of visual short films where fashion and narrative intricately intertwine, inviting viewers to step into a world crafted with impeccable style and profound artistic intention.</p>
